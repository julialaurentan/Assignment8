1. CAN CRASH
- while loop does not check for whether the condition is true or false, instead sets a value
- *p in for loop is not a condition

2. 4 bytes
Because that is the size of one char pointer.

3. lines 18-24, 29-30

4. Between 32 and 33: free(*p);
14: single quotes around 0
I'm not sure how to fix the while loop and for loop sorry
